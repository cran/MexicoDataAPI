## Note on World Bank Open Data API and REST Countries

The `MexicoDataAPI` package depends on two public RESTful APIs for accessing Argentine and global data:

1. **World Bank Open Data API**

The **World Bank Open Data API** is a RESTful web service that provides access to a vast collection of international development indicators. It allows for real-time retrieval of economic, social, and environmental data, including metrics such as GDP, population, education, and poverty levels.

This API is publicly accessible, requires **no authentication**, and returns results in either **JSON** or **XML** format. It supports filtering by country, indicator code, and year. It is widely used in data science, research, and educational contexts.

In the `MexicoDataAPI` package, the API is used to **dynamically retrieve and display real-time indicators for Mexico**. 
Data is accessed live via HTTP requests to the API and shown directly in the R console. **No data is stored or redistributed** by this package.

2. **REST Countries API**  
   An open-source project that offers information about countries worldwide, including demographics, geography, and regional groupings.  
   This API is also publicly accessible and does not require authentication.

As per the maintainers of both APIs, **no attribution is required** for using or distributing the data.  
However, we recommend reviewing the official documentation and usage terms on their respective websites to ensure proper understanding and responsible use.
